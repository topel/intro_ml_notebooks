# intro_ml_notebooks

In this repo I intend to post the notebooks I write for the lecture *Introduction to Machine Learning*, given to first year Master students at UPS, Toulouse, 2018

[1 - Bayesian decision with Gaussian distributions](https://github.com/topel/intro_ml_notebooks/blob/master/Bayesian_decision_with_Gaussian_distributions.ipynb)

[2 - Expectation Maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures](https://github.com/topel/intro_ml_notebooks/blob/master/Expectation_Maximization_algorithm_for_Gaussian_mixtures.ipynb)
